# Supervised Machine Learning Model @ Ironhack Paris

## Define The Problem

Churn Rate is the rate of customer attrition in a company, or the speed at which a customer leaves your company. Itâ€™s more expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current one, therefore a small increase in customer retention equates to a large decrease in company costs, greatly benefiting a company.

The objectives of this project is to:
- Reduce Account Closure
- Increase Customer / Service Ratio
- Reduce Bank Service Transfer


## Roadmap

- Gather data on customer behavior
- Use the data to predict and segment customers who are likely to churn
- Create models to demonstrate churn risk on company revenue
- Design and implement intervention strategy on segmented customers
- Repeat every fiscal year

## Understand the Data

The dataset used was provided by Kaggle.com

- [Churn Prediction of Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/sonalidasgupta95/churn-prediction-of-bank-customers#Churn_Modelling.csv)

After cleaning and exploring the data, I focused on factors that may have the most impact on Churn rate

- Number of Products
- Age
- Credit Score
- Tenure
- Has a Credit Card
